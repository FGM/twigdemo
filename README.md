This is a minimal demo of Twig.

To install it, use composer by running 

    composer install

Then, assuming you are using PHP >= 5.4, go to the `public` directory by typing

    cd public
    
And launch the PHP builtin web server on port 8000

    php -S localhost:8000
    
You should now see the demo in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000

You can :

  * customize your template in `templates/index.html.twig`.
  * make new variables available to your template by defining them in the `config/vars.php`.
